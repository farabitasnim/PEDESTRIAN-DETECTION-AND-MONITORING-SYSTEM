# PEDESTRIAN-DETECTION-AND-MONITORING-SYSTEM
This is a pedestrian detection and monitoring system that detects pedestrians in front of the car and calculate their distance from the car.If the distance is more than a certain threshold then it generates an alert message to the driver in order to stop the car .It is created using YOLO framework.The inference is saved and used with recorded videos in streets of Malacca,Malaysia to see the result.The non-maximal suppression has assisted in reducing the overlapping of the bounding boxes.The technology can be used for self-driving autonomous cars.
